In manufacturing, this would look like building a machine that can accomplish portions of a task with less human effort. By reducing the amount of work that we have to put into a process, we free ourselves up to focus on the tasks that are not so easily accomplished by anyone besides a competent human being (us). \n\nThink of a program as really tiny machinery. Your goal is to make a machine (in code) that can accomplish routine tasks for you. When you're done, you get to focus on other important tasks that demand your attention. For example, you might want to spend your time working on a forecast model, but first you need to check to make sure that all values in your time series are valid. You COULD just open up your data, and look at every record to make sure that each fits the rules that valid data should follow. Or you could write a program that can check every line for you, and either alert you to problems, or possibly fix them without you even having to be involved. Then, all of your time is freed for the forecasting model.\n\nLast week we talked about some of the types of information that we can store in Python. This week, we will start to learn about the tools that are baked into Python that allow us to begin the process of automation."

If you haven't noticed this yet, you will soon note that Python (and all other programming languages) are VERY literal. Things that we don't intend will occur whenever we assume that a computer will interpret an ambiguous statement in a single anticipated (by humans) way. Eventually, you will get used to being very careful when describing conditions in your code, and these problems will become less of an issue.\n\nIn Python, we have keywords that we can use to express different kinds of logic. Let's get started by talking about `if` statements. `if` statements function in Python pretty much the same way that they do in English: you state a condition, and then explain what should happen if that condition is met. You can then list alternative outcomes with the conditions that should be met prior to implementing those contingency plans. Finally, you can list what to do in any other outcomes that were not explicity described. Let's try this out:"

It tells Python to evaluate it's truthiness if the condition above it fails. In other words, the `elif` statement is only evaluated in this case when `xBig & xBigger` is `False`. If the `elif` statement is evaluated as `True`, then its assigned print statement is executed and we skip the `else` block that follows.\n\nIf the `elif` statement is *also* `False`, then we reach the `else` statement, which is automatically executed and prints the final print statement. `else` indicates that the code should associated with it should be run when all previous logical statements in the block are evaluated as `False`. It will not run if *any* of the previous statements evaluate as `True`.\n\nWhen writing logical blocks, we always write our code in the following order: \n\n1) Write an `if` statement, and its corresponding code block \n\n2) If needed, write as many `elif` statements as needed, along with their corresponding code blocks. **NOTE**: `elif` statements will be evaluated from top to bottom in the code, and once a single `elif` statement is evaluated as `True`, none of the subsequent `elif` statements will be evaluated. Put your `elif` statements in the order that you want them to be prioritized! \n\n3) If needed, write an `else` statement that will apply to all events not covered by `if` or `elif` statements"

Not ideal, but functional. Then I did it again!

We are writing code that will iteratively work its way through each specified record, and will **loop** through the same logic for each of those records. Wouldn't it be easier if we could just specify the pattern of behavior we expect, and not have to walk our program through each specific iteration?\n\nYes.

We even end it with a colon like we would in English!\n\n`i` becomes a **placeholder**, or a variable that will be temporarily assigned each time our loop goes to work. It will use each entry in `forecastData` one time, and while a given entry is being used, it will have the nickname `i`. That way, we can write all the code in our loop to describe what should happen to `i`. Then, in each pass of the loop, `i` takes the next value, and we follow the same set of instructions. In this case, we are just checking that our variables meet the established criteria, and then printing `True` if they do, or `False` if they don't.\n\nOne awesome side effect of this version of loops is that we can easily update our loop if there is a mistake or change to the pattern, and we only have to do so ONE time!

This means that we can allow a `while` loop to repeat indefinitely. \n\nA **stopping rule** is the logical statement that is checked before each iteration of a `while` loop. Whenever this condition is evaluated as `True`, then the loop is executed. When the condition is evaluated as `False`, the loop is terminated and the program advances to subsequent commands. This is where the term **infinite loop** comes from! If we forget to update our stopping condition within our `while` loop, then it will never stop, because we never tell it to stop. It is **really** important to remember this when we are writing `while` loops, or we will probably crash our program if not our computer.\n\nA fun example of a while loop would be writing a function to prompt the user to add numbers until the sum is above 42:"
