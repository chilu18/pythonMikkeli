      "source": "## What is Regular Expression?\n\nWorking with text is HARD. Do we consider \"dog\" to be different from \"dogs\"? How do we explain to a computer if we want those words to be considered the same word? In written language, most rules are not really rules, but patterns within text. Regular expression is a paradigm for describing patterns in text in order to accomodate the flexibility of written language and our attempts to find information within larger bodies of text.\n\nFor example, I might want to find a series of keywords within a body of text in order to determine whether or not the topic of the text has been correctly identified (or even in order to determine what the topic of the text actually is!). Regular expression has the ability to help express patterns in text that we may want to examine, and the flexibility to determine exactly how we want to capture it. Some common uses of regular expression:\n\n- Validating emails, phone numbers, addresses, and other text blocks\n- Finding subsets of a document\n- Determining the presence or count of particular words, phrases or patterns\n- Web Scraping\n- Grammar suggestions\n\nThere are, of course many more ways to use regular expression. Let's start looking at how we can use it in our personal data analysis."

          "text": "Chapter 44\n\n\nElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit\nher the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\nresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\nBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\narrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\nplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\nto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\ncarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\na curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\nthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\nsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\nexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\nthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\nquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\nnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\nElizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\namazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\nshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\nin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\nsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n\nShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\nup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\ninquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n\nMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.\n\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\n\nThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\nwas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\nstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\nfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\ncordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\ninquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\nand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\nwhat it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\nin doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\nevident enough.\n\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\nto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\n\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\nhow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\na like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\nthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\nthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\nbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\nappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\nbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\nshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\nere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\nrecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\nmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\nto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\nwhich had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since\nhe had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,\nhe added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\nNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”\n\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\nnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\ngave them meaning.\n\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\nbut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\nfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\nof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\ndisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\nso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\nat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\ncould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.\n\nTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing\ntheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\nat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\ndiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\nreadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\nhow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\nacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\nthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\nany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\nsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\nher attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n\nBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\nagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\nmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\nthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\nthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\nvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\nsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\nlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\nuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\nfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n\nBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\nnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\nwould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\nnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\nit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\nwhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\nwas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\n\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\nson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\n\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\nand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\nhis favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\nIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\nbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\nacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\naccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\nher as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\neager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\nof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\nwere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\non making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\npride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\nlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\nsort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\nexactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\nshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how\nfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would\nbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her\nfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of\nhis addresses.\n\nIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the\nvery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a\nlate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,\nby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that\nit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.\n\nMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been\nrenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting\nsome of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.\n\n\n\nChapter 45\n\n\nConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had\noriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her\nappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how\nmuch civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.\n\nOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,\nwhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\n\nIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\nall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear\nof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior\nthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,\nhowever, did her justice, and pitied her.\n\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.\n\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\n\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many\na significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected\nthem round the table.\n\nWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.\n\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:\n\n“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”\n\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\nhave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected\nwith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\nwish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\n\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\n\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss\nBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,\nbehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's\nrecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not\nerr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana\nwithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When\nDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to\nhim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\n“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she\ncried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since\nthe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing\nthat we should not have known her again.”\n\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\n“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could\nsee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\nwants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\nwhich have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\nnot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.”\n\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued:\n\n“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.”\n\n“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_\nwas only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”\n\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.\n\nMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their\nvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them\nboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,\nexcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked\nof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but\nhimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of\nhim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's\nbeginning the subject.\n\n\n",

First, we used `()` to encapsulate a portion of the word Elizabeth that may not be present in some cases. Parens (`()`) create **groups** in regular expression. Sometimes we will want to capture groups from within an expression, and other times we will only want to indicate that a group may or may not be present. In this case, we indicate that the sequence `beth` is not strictly required for a match by using a `?` character after the group. This doesn't mean that our text needs to include a `?`. The `?` symbol says \"I want either 1 or 0 matches to the \"beth\" sequence.\n\nIn other words, \"beth\" may be present (have one match) or not present (have zero matches) while still allowing us to have a successful match to our regular expression pattern. There are several similar expressions:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning |\n| --- | :---: |\n| `?` | 1 or 0 repetitions|\n| `+` | 1 or more repetitions | \n| `*` | 0 or more repetitions |\n|`{n}` | exactly `n` repetitions|\n|`{m,n}` | between `m` and `n` repetitions|\n\nWe can use these expressions with groups, or with single characters. What if we wanted to find the end of sentences in our text? Let's try and express that:"

Let's try to detect this pattern in text that is provided by the user. Before we get started, let's talk about how we can identify numbers.\n\nWhen we look for numbers, we typically are not looking for a single specific number (like 42). We are instead looking for **some** number. It might be 2, it might be 142, or it might be 1000. Let's look for a number in the following sentence:"

We looked for all periods (`.`), question marks (`?`), and exclamation marks (`!`). Unfortunately, not all periods come at the end of sentences! In *Pride and Prejudice*, many characters are referred to as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\". Those periods are followed by spaces, and so would have counted as the end of a sentence.\n\n#### Negative Lookbehind\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we need a new tool: the **negative lookbehind**. A negative lookbehind is a pattern that must be matched while simultaneously NOT being preceded by another pattern. In this case, we would want `[.?!]` wherever that character set is NOT preceded by `Mr` or `Mrs`. First, let's make sure that we can find `Mr` and `Mrs` with a single expression:"
