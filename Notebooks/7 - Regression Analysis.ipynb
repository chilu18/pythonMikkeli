Strictly speaking, this is true; linear regression takes data as an input, and updates its rule set based on that data to model an outcome. This is the basis for machine learning! On the other hand, linear regression as a statistical tool definitely predates the machine learning movement, and has been used for over 200 years. It is well understood, and is readily accepted as a means of analysis.\n\nWhether or not you think of it as machine learning, it is a great place to get started when learning about data modeling through statistics. Let's build up some intuition for how linear regression works before we learn to use it."

The big catch with statistical models is statistical models do not successfully identify **causation**. Statistical models instead identify **correlation**, and leave **causation** to domain expertise.\n\n- **Correlation**: a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. In statistics, we even use measures such as the correlation coefficient to describe the intensity of the relationship between two variables. In order for the relationship between two variables to be a **causal** relationship, there must first be **correlation** between those variables.\n\n- **Causation**: the act of causing something. This is the relationship that statistical models want to measure! Unfortunately, statistics alone can't get us to **causation**. In order to establish a **causal** relationship, we must combine correlation between two variables with an explanation of *how* one of those variables can lead to changes in the other."

Is it possible that $y$ causes $x$ instead?\n2. Is it possible that $z$ (a new factor that we haven't considered before) is causing both $x$ and $y$?\n3. Could the relationship have been observed by chance?\n\nIf we can demonstrate that each of these questions is unlikely to be answered in the affirmative, and we observe correlation between two variables, then we can begin to assert that the relationship may be causal."

In the context of an RCT, the experiment is designed such that only one variable is experimented upon. By assigning random individuals (or entities, groups, etc.) to the treatment and control groups, the researcher can use univariate statistical tests to determine the relationship between the variable of interest (called the treatment variable) and the outcome (dependent variable).\n\nUnfortunately, there are **many** contexts in which creating an RCT is not feasible. This may be due to the data collection method, it may be due to ethical concerns, or some other internal or external factor. Where we cannot perform an RCT, regression analysis becomes our next best option."

      "source": "## Regression Analysis\n\nIf you have ever created a trend line in Excel or Tableau (or any similar software), then you have implemented a form of regression analysis. The beauty of regression analysis is in its ability to be **more** than just a trend line on a plot. While a trendline is valuable, it is only helpful when describing the relationship between two (and maybe three) variables, regression analysis makes it possible to create the analog to a trendline using **as many variables as you would like** (so long as you have more observations than variables).\n\nThe underlying concept (we won't go into the math here) is that we want to statistically separate the effect of each variable on the outcome. In other words, what happens to our outcome when we vary only one of our many variables at a time? All of the math behind regression analysis is designed to answer this question. This means that regression analysis\n\n- Allows us to **act as if nothing else were changing**\n- Mathematicaly isolates the effect of each individual **variable** on the outcome of interest\n    - Variables are the factors that we want to include in our model\n    \nWhen we look at the output of a regression, then, we are looking at an equation that tells us how to add up the impacts of each variable to estimate the value of our dependent variable! Not only can we understand the impact of each individual variable, but we can also forecast the dependent variable for use in predictive modeling.\n\n\n### Regression Terms\n\nAs we move forward, it will be helpful to keep in mind the following definitions:\n\n- **Coefficient**: This is the effect of changing a variable by one unit (from “untreated” to “treated”)\n- **Standard Error (Standard Deviation)**: Measures how noisy the effect of the independent variable is on the dependent variable\n    - Larger numbers indicate more noise\n- **Confidence Interval**: Assuming our regression analysis includes all relevant information, we expect that the true coefficient (treatment effect) lies within this range 95% of the time (for a 95% confidence interval)\n\n- **Statistical Significance**: When the Average Treatment Effect has a confidence interval (at 95% or 99% levels, typically) that does not include 0\n\n\n\n### Regression Assumptions\n\nIt is important to note that the statistical models underlying linear regression depend on several assumptions:\n\n1. Effects are Linear (there are some workarounds)\n2. Errors are normally distributed (bell-shaped)\n3. Variables are not Collinear\n4. No Autocorrelation (problematic for time series data)\n5. Homoskedasticity (errors are shaped the same across all observations)\n\nWhile the study of these assumptions is essential for a practitioner, and frequently occupies an entire semester-long course, it is sufficient for us to state these assumptions, and be aware of the fact that these assumptions are baked into the models. It is equally important to know that adaptations of regression analysis exist to work around violations of each assumption where needed.\n\nMost regressions implemented in the real world must account for violations of one or more assumptions."

Regressions are very powerful transparent models, by which I mean that it is straightforward to see how each variable leads to the predicted outcome. Whenever we want to establish causality (and can't put together an RCT), regression models are the *de facto* standard for understanding how one variable causes the other to change.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to just predict WHAT will happen next, there exist much better tools for you! We will spend many class sessions discussing these models during the remainder of this course."

      "source": "Linear regression is typically used to describe outcomes in which the value is continuous. This could be a model of the amount of profit generated through various business practices, the population density of a region, or any other metric that can be measured on a more or less continuous scale. Less frequently, linear regression is used to model outcomes that represent discrete outcomes such as success or failure, or to model the probability of success or failure. This is called a **linear probability model (LPM)**.\n\nWhy might LPMs not be used very often? Let's think about probability, as well as the properties of a linear regression model. A probability is a measure of likelihood, and is typically measured on the scale of $[0,1]$, or from 0% to 100% probability. A probability of 0 (0%) indicates that there is no likelihood that an event will take place. On the other hand, a probability of 1 (100%) would suggest absolute certainty that an outcome will occur. The important point, no matter which measurement of probability we choose to use, is that probabilities are **bounded** (cannot go beyond) absolute certainty of failure or absolute certainty of success.\n\nRemember linear regression? One important part of any linear regression model is the **linearity** of the model. While this seems obvious, it is this part of the linear regression that gets us in trouble as we use LPMs. Any linear function with a nonzero slope will by definition be **unbounded**, and will NOT remain within the $[0, 1]$ interval. This means that an LPM will inevitably provide predictions that are non-sensical! Through our LPM, we will get some predictions that fit into each of the following categories:\n\n- Totally normal predictions, with probabilities between 0 and 1\n- Weird probabilities #1, with probability above 1 (or a likelihood of greater than 100%, which doesn't make sense!)\n- Weird probabilities #2, with probability below 0 (or a negative likelihood, which again doesn't make sense!)"

      "source": "Is there a better way to model probabilities using regression analysis? You bet there is! It is called **logistic regression**, and we will learn how to do it, right here, right now. But first, let's explore why it is an improvement over LPMs. Remember that the big problem with LPMs is their linearity, right? It is the part of a regression that makes regression analysis so simple to understand, but also the part that breaks our probability model. We want to redesign our regression model to **resemble** a linear model, but stay within the $[0, 1]$ interval.\n\nWhen we use a linear regression model, we end up with a series of coefficients. Those are the slope parameters for a linear equation resulting in our prediction of the dependent variable (outcome). We typically refer to each coefficient as a $\\beta$ (beta) term, with subscripts ($\\beta_i$) denoting which coefficient we are referring to. If we use the same subscripts to describe our $x$ variables, then we can write our regression equation (with $k$ variables) as follows:\n\n$$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 ... + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k$$\n\nObviously, as our $x$ values increase, our $y$ either increases or decreases, depending on the sign and magnitude of the associated $\\beta$ coefficient. If those $x$'s get sufficiently large, so does $y$! In fact, it can go as high as $\\infty$ and as low as $-\\infty$. This is a problem now we are dealing with probability.\n\nTo fix our regression equation, we make a really simple transformation called the **logistic transformation**. After the transformation, our regression equation is written as follows:\n\n$$ y = \\frac{exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 ... + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k)}{1+ exp(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\beta_2 \\cdot x_2 ... + \\beta_k \\cdot x_k)} $$\n\nwhere $exp()$ represents Euler's number raised to the power of the internal element (in our case, our original linear regression function).\n\nWhy do we choose this function? Several reasons:\n\n- It is a simple transformation\n- It leads to interpretable coefficients (remember that we want those!)\n- It is bounded by $[0,1]$ like we want\n\nHow is it bounded? Remember that our linear regression function can go to either $\\infty$ or $-\\infty$. If the linear function takes the value $\\infty$, then our logistic function becomes\n\n$$ y = \\frac{\\infty}{1+\\infty} \\approx 1$$\n\nbecause $exp(\\infty)=\\infty$. When the linear function takes the value $-\\infty$, then $exp(-\\infty)=0$, so our logistic function becomes\n\n$$ y = \\frac{0}{1} = 0 $$\n\nand we remain within our probability bounds!"

      "source": "The confusing part of logistic regression stems from understanding the difference between coefficients in linear regression and in logistic regression. In linear regression, a coefficient describes the change in the dependent variable resulting from a one unit **increase** in the independent variable associated with that coefficient. If, for example, the coefficient of age on income (in Euros) is &#128;1,000, then an individual would be expected to earn &#128;1,000 more if he or she were 1 year older, or &#128;1,000 less if he or she were 1 year younger.\n\nIn a logistic regression, our coefficient is not a linear treatment effect. Instead, coefficients represent the **log odds ratio**, which can be written as\n\n$$ \\beta = ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) $$\n\nIf the **log odds ratio** is greater than 0, then a one unit increase in the associated variable would lead to an increased likelihood of success in the dependent variable. If the value is below 0, then the likelihood of success diminishes. The effects are not linear, but they do reflect the direction of the trend and can be interpreted to understand the relationship that each variable has with the outcome."
