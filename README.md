# Tools for Data Analysis - Syllabus
### A Data Science Course for Aalto University in Mikkeli
Instructor: Dr. Dustin White

### Course Description

This  course  is  intended to  introduce  the  student  to  programming  languages  as  tools  for  conducting  data analysis, focusing on Python in particular. The course will cover basic principles of programming languages, as well as libraries useful in collecting, cleaning and analyzing data in order to answer research questions. Students will learn to use Python to apply forecasting tools and predictive models to business settings. The course will be divided between lecture and lab time, and labs will be focused on teaching students how to implement the programming techniques and statistical models discussed in lectures.

### Class Schedule

#### Day 1

Introduction to using Python. We will cover opening notebooks, and basic functions in Python.

#### Day 2

Loops and Conditions. We will focus on creating logical conditions for our programs to meet, as well as looping through code to streamline repeated processes.

#### Day 3

Functions. Creating functions in a programming language allows us to reuse code in many contexts and to solve new problems. We will explore how to do this in Python so that we better understand the code we will be using moving forward.

#### Day 4

Data Frames and Pandas. We will practice importing and utilizing data in Python. This is the basis for being able to conduct analysis in Python.

#### Day 5

Numpy, Scipy, and math in Python. In order to perform complex mathematical and statistical functions, we can use pre-built libraries like Numpy and Scipy. These libraries include functions for generating pseudo-random numbers, sampling from statistical distributions, and working with matrices and vectors.

#### Day 6

Plotting in Python. We will create visuals using Python to be able to supplement the stories that we tell with data through visual media.

#### Day 7

Introducing Linear Regression and its implementation in Python. Linear regression provides a jumping-off point for statistical analysis, and gives us a chance to prepare our data for analysis.

#### Day 8

Logistic Regression in Python. Logistic regression is our first model capable of performing classification. We will discuss differences between linear and logistic regression, and implement models in code.

#### Day 9

Classification and Regression Trees. Decision trees will give us a chance to discuss machine learning and why it differs from regression analysis.

#### Day 10

Support Vector Machines. We will discuss the difference in approach between Decision Trees and SVMs, and implement the latter as we explore more model options.

#### Day 11

Random Forests and ensemble methods. Ensemble methods provide improved accuracy and robustness relative to single machine learning models. We will explore these properties through random forest models.

#### Day 12

Clustering models. We will explore unsupervised learning through the k-means clustering algorithm, and learn about trying to identify various groups of observations within data, both as a tool for prediction, as well as for better understanding the available data.

#### Day 13

Regular Expression and text analysis. Sometimes it is advantageous to be able to process text into quantifiable information. Regex provides us the capability to transform text and quickly extract patterns from raw data.

#### Day 14

Project Workday. We will use the time that we have today to finalize our projects and presentations for the last day of class.

#### Day 15

Project presentations. Each student will present a brief summary of a research question they have answered during the term, and policy implications from the results that they have uncovered.

### Assignments

Assignments will be completed in Mimir, and will correspond to each of the topics covered in class.

### Project

Each student will be asked to find a research question based on data from the [European Data Portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/en). Using the tools covered in class, each student will address their research question in a brief written report, and prepare a short presentation to be given on the final day of class. This project is intended to provide students the opportunity to showcase their learning through this course in a way that can be discussed in job interviews and other contexts where data analysis is a valuable skill.

### Academic Integrity

If I find that you have plagiarized, been dishonest in completing your assignments, or cheated an an exam or assignment, then I reserve the right to award you no points on the entire exam, project, or assignment and to report the behavior to the university. I also reserve the right to award a failing grade, independent of your score on other assignments. Academic integrity is essential to education, and I take it very seriously.

### Students with Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations are provided for students who are registered with Disability Services and make their requests sufficiently in advance. Please contact me so we can make arragements that suit your needs.
